THE ORIGINAL DATA ARE NOT KEPT HERE FOR THE SAKE OF THE STORAGE CAPACITY. CHECK THE .pickle IN THE LOCAL MACBOOK FOLDER (path: /Users/cristobal/Documents/Master UC3M/s_cuatrimestre4/TFM). STILL, EVEN THERE SOME SUB-SETS OF THE DATA REQUIRED FOR THE CODE FUNCTIONALITY ARE MISSING. IN PARTICULAR:

- imageset_cam1.pickle (Images with only cam1, hence a third of the space. Obtained through the snippet take_cam1.py)
- imageset_reduced.pickle (Only cam 1 and aerosol, multinube and nimbostrato types removed. Obtained through one of the cells of the notebook review_resnet_code.ipynb)
- metadata_reduced.pickle (Metadata for excluded aerosol, multinube and nimbostrato types instances. Obtained through the same notebook as imagest_reduced.pickle)
- results (directory) (Directory containing the results of the different trained models)

All of the previous can be found in the UC3M server provided to develop the project under the user csanchezmoreno
